Since February 2020 I have been the head of the DigiLab & Development unit, an innovation and development unit, for SaarLB (Landesbank Saar) in Saarbrücken. In addition, since February 2019 I have been working irregularly as a lecturer for cryptography and information security at the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University.

Between March 2017 and February 2020 I worked as Information Security Officer for SaarLB (Landesbank Saar). From May 2016 to February 2017 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the Technical University of Darmstadt in the SECUSO (Security, Usability, and Society) group (now at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). I completed my doctorate at the Technical University of Darmstadt in 2016. I furthermore completed my bachelor's and master's degree in computer science in 2009 and 2011 respectively at Saarland University. I completed parts of my studies and my doctorate at the Università di Bologna (Host: Prof. Dr. Marco Prandini). I completed further scientific stays at the University of Bristol and at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.

My research deals with questions of usable IT security and applied cryptography, with a special focus on the security of electronic voting systems, secure digital communication and security awareness. Recently, my interest has increasingly focused on the possibilities of modern cryptography and its application to protect privacy, e.g. fully homomorphic cryptography (FHE), multi party computation (MPC) and post quantum cryptography (PQC). My research resulted in more than 40 publications, including academic papers at major international conferences and in major international journals such as IFIP SEC, IEEE Security & Privacy and ARES. The most relevant result of my research is the development of a framework for evaluating the security of internet voting systems (SecIVo: a quantitative security evaluation framework for internet voting schemes and Election-Dependent Security Evaluation of Internet Voting Schemes) as well as the development of the internet voting system Pretty Understandable Democracy and the work on the practicability of the coercion-resistant internet voting system Civitas (Civitas and the real world und Towards A Practical JCJ / Civitas Implementation). In further research I dealt with the usability of the end-to-end verifiable Helios internet voting system (Helios Verification: To Alleviate, or to Nominate: Is That the Question, or Shall we Have Both?) as well as security awareness for SMEs (Don’t Be Deceived: The Message Might Be Fake and Effektiver Schutz vor betrügerischen Nachrichten).

I am/was editor/organizer/reviewer of various international journals and conferences, including Journal of Information Security and Applications, Cryptography – Open Access Journal, Security, Privacy, and Authentication section of the Frontiers in Communications and Networks, the Elsevier Journal Government Information Quarterly, the Elsevier Journal of Information Security and Applications, the International Conference on E-voting and Identity (formerly VoteID, now E-Vote-ID) as well as the International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES) (since 2020).
In 2016, as an advisor to the Council of Europe, I contributed to the revision of Recommendation CM/Rec(2017)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on standards for e-voting. In 2021, I was invited as a subject matter expert for a study on the 2023 Social Security election (German: Sozialversicherungswahlen). In 2012, I was accepted into the Software Campus management development program to implement a research project BoRoVo (secure, robust, efficient and flexible, decentralized voting systems for spontaneous elections in management) (approved funding projects receive funding of up to 100,000 euros from the BMBF).

I was an invited guest speaker at the Bitkom Academy, the Friedrich Naumann Foundation and the University of Bristol. Irregularly, I offer guest lectures at universities, e.g. at the Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA). I was a co-initiator and invited expert of the Cybersecurity Day 2021 at the East Side Fab (in 2022 the Cybersecurity Day was expanded with a hackathon).

I am a member of the German Informatics Society and the IACR - International Association for Cryptologic Research.

My Erdős number is 3 (Stephan Neumann - Johannes Buchmann - Kálmán Győry - Paul Erdős).
