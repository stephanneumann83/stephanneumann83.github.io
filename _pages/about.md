I am assistant professor at the IT University of Copenhagen (<a href="https://www.itu.dk">ITU</a>) and a member of the Center for Information Security and Trust (<a href="https://cist.dk">CIST</a>). I have previously worked as a postdoc in the Security, Usability and Society (<a href="https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/index.php">SECUSO</a>) research group at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.kit.edu">KIT</a>) and Technische Universität Darmstadt (<a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de">TUD</a>), and received my doctorate from TUD in 2017.

My research interests focus on human factors in security and privacy, including privacy-related decision support for end users and risk communication, as well as issues of security and privacy in electronic voting. I also work as a part-time researcher at SECUSO, collaborating on the EU Project "Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control" (<a href="https://www.ghost-iot.eu">GHOST</a>).
