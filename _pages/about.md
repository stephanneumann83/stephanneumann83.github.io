Since February 2020 I have been the head of the DigiLab & Development unit, an innovation and development unit, for [SaarLB](https://www.saarlb.de) (Landesbank Saar) in Saarbrücken. In addition, since February 2019 I have been working irregularly as a lecturer for cryptography and information security at the [Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de). From time to time, I offer guest lectures at academic institutions, e.g. at the [Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)](https://cms.cispa.saarland/poser_2122/).

Between March 2017 and February 2020 I worked as Information Security Officer for [SaarLB](https://www.saarlb.de) (Landesbank Saar). From May 2016 to February 2017 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de) in the [SECUSO](https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu) (Security, Usability, and Society) group (now at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu)). 

I completed my [doctorate](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000081975/16982010) at the [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de) under the supervision of [Melanie Volkamer](https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/Team_Volkamer.php) in 2016. I furthermore completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science in 2009 and 2011 respectively at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html). I spent parts of my studies and my doctorate at the [Università di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) under the supervision of [Marco Prandini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/marco.prandini). I furthermore carried out research stays at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) and at the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/). I [graduated](https://softwarecampus.de/certificates/16558/) in 2015 from the the [Software Campus](https://softwarecampus.de), a graduate development program for future IT executives, with the admitted research project [BoRoVo](https://softwarecampus.de/certificates/16558/).

My research deals with questions of usable IT security and applied cryptography, with a special focus on the security of electronic voting systems, secure digital communication and security awareness. Recently, my interest has increasingly focused on the possibilities of modern cryptography and its application to protect privacy, e.g. [fully homomorphic cryptography](https://shaih.github.io/pubs/he-chapter.pdf) (FHE), [secure multi party computation](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pragmaticmpc/pragmaticmpc.pdf) (MPC) and [post quantum cryptography](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144828958.pdf) (PQC). My research resulted in more than 40 publications, including academic papers at renowned international conferences and in renowned international journals such as [IFIP SEC](https://www.ifipsec.org), [IEEE Security & Privacy](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp), [ARES](https://www.ares-conference.eu), and the [Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC)](https://fc17.ifca.ai/). 

<!-- The most relevant result of my research is the development of a framework for evaluating the security of internet voting systems (SecIVo: a quantitative security evaluation framework for internet voting schemes and Election-Dependent Security Evaluation of Internet Voting Schemes) as well as the development of the internet voting system Pretty Understandable Democracy and the work on the practicability of the coercion-resistant internet voting system Civitas (Civitas and the real world und Towards A Practical JCJ / Civitas Implementation). In further research I dealt with the usability of the end-to-end verifiable Helios internet voting system (Helios Verification: To Alleviate, or to Nominate: Is That the Question, or Shall we Have Both?) as well as security awareness for SMEs (Don’t Be Deceived: The Message Might Be Fake and Effektiver Schutz vor betrügerischen Nachrichten). -->

I serve(d) as editor, organizer, and reviewer of various international conferences and journals, including the [Journal of Information Security and Applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-information-security-and-applications), [Cryptography – Open Access Journal](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cryptography), as well as the [International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES)](https://www.ares-conference.eu) (since 2020) - refer to the [Service](http://stephanneumann83.github.io/services/) section for a detailed list.  In 2016, as an advisor to the Council of Europe, I contributed to the revision of [Recommendation CM/Rec(2017)5](https://rm.coe.int/0900001680726f6f) of the Committee of Ministers to member States on standards for e-voting. In 2021, I was invited as a subject matter expert for a study on the 2023 Social Security election (German: Sozialversicherungswahlen). 

I was an invited guest speaker at the [Bitkom Academy](https://bitkom-akademie.de), the [Friedrich Naumann Foundation](https://www.freiheit.org/de) and the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). I was a co-initiator and invited expert of the [Cybersecurity Day 2021](https://eastsidefab.de/cybersecurity-keine-option-sondern-ein-muss/) (see [Flyer](https://www.stephanneumann.de/files/Cybersecurity-Day-Flyer.pdf)) and [Cybersecurity Day 2022](https://eastsidefab.de/cybersecurity-day-2022/) (see [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5UM_QWAYo)) respectively at the [East Side Fab](https://eastsidefab.de/) (in 2022, additionally a hackathon (see [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BG7ByAD2A)) took place).

I am a member of the [German Informatics Society](https://www.gi.de) and the [IACR - International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://www.iacr.org). My Erdős number is 3 (Stephan Neumann - [Johannes Buchmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Buchmann) - [Kálmán Győry](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Győry_Kálmán) - [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdős)).
