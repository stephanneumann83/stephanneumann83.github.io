I am associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen (<a href="https://www.itu.dk">ITU</a>) and a member of the Center for Information Security and Trust (<a href="https://cist.dk">CIST</a>). I have previously worked as a post-doc in the Security, Usability and Society (<a href="https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/index.php">SECUSO</a>) research group at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.kit.edu">KIT</a>), in particular, collaborating on the EU Project "Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control" (<a href="https://www.ghost-iot.eu">GHOST</a>), and before that, at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (<a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de">TUDa</a>). I have received my doctorate from TUDa in 2017.

My research interests focus on human factors in security and privacy, including privacy-related decision support for end users and risk communication, as well as issues of security and privacy in electronic voting. Until December 2020, I have also been working as a co-PI on the [ASCD](https://ascd.dk) project funded by the [Danish Centre for Cybersecurity](https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx), investigating cybersecurity and privacy practices in Danish companies. Starting from January 2022, I am working as a PI for the project COMET (Communicating trust in the security of election technologies) funded by <a href="https://veluxfoundations.dk/en">Vellux Foundation</a> (Villum Experiment Program). The purpose of the project is to understand how trust in election technologies is created and maintained among the voters, and how should voting systems be designed in order to facilitate this trust.
